IDEAS

- some way to stop ensure the report job doesnt get stuck between 1000 url jobs
- create a relationship redirects_to for 302s and enqueue the redirect url
- can we change Page.retrieve_links_for(page) to be page.retrieve_links ?
- is there a better way to count all pages rather than iterating through all nodes?
- named params would be nice. eg HttpResponse.new(:status => 200, :content => html) instead of HttpResponse.new(200, html)

sp:

- store whether link is relative
- add end2end test that handles cycles
