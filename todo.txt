the page.store calling the Store module method is a bit different - would ppl normally make Store an object? or a mixin?

process quit hell
- start the queue , ctrl-c and it will exit after a pause
- enqueue a job that stores link in node4j, ctrl-c will no longer work no longer how long you patiently wait
- run fun.rb and it will quit after ctrl-c (after a pause - uncertain whether it is the same length of the time as the first pause) , otherwise, it will never end

hypothesis - neo4j launches a thread and the joins it... 

get ola to look into this

i'd like to know the diff btw a 404 and a domain not found

named params would be nice. eg HttpResponse.new(:status => 200, :content => html) instead of HttpResponse.new(200, html)
