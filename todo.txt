IDEAS

- some way to stop ensure the report job doesnt get stuck between 1000 url jobs (put reports in a different higher priority queue!)
- create a relationship redirects_to for 302s and enqueue the redirect url
- is there a better way to count all pages rather than iterating through all nodes?
- store status
- store whether link is relative
- store.good_pages includes pages we have not yet visited

- throttle queue - install https://github.com/flyerhzm/resque-restriction 
- make sure we can run the report after stopping spidie

sc:
- don't follow links that are not qld gov 
  - test dont run report til queue is empty
