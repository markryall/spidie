IDEAS

- some way to stop ensure the report job doesnt get stuck between 1000 url jobs
- create a relationship redirects_to for 302s and enqueue the redirect url
- is there a better way to count all pages rather than iterating through all nodes?
- store status
- store whether link is relative
- store.good_pages includes pages we have not yet visited
