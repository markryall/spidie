IDEAS
- make PageNode and Page the same thing
- create a ReportJob which outputs a report as json
- make end2end test use this ReportJob and make assertions about it
- is there a way to embed the sinatra application in the acceptance test instead of starting it in rake file?

CURRENT


DONE
- add end2end test to build
- added convenience tasks
- got specs passing
