IDEAS
- make PageNode and Page the same thing
- create a ReportJob which outputs a report as json
- make end2end test use this ReportJob and make assertions about it

CURRENT
- work on pending spec - change page retrieval so we can store the http status

DONE
- add end2end test to build
- added convenience tasks
- got specs passing
