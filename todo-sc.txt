IDEAS

- make end2end test use this ReportJob and make assertions about it
- some way to stop ensure the report job doesnt get stuck between 1000 url jobs
- create a relationship redirects_to for 302s and enqueue the redirect url
- change log {"msg"} to log "msg"
- can we change Page.retrieve_links_for(page) to be page.retrieve_links ?
- is there a better way to count all pages rather than iterating through all nodes?

CURRENT

- fix other end2end tests to use report, not TestJob
